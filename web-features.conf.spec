[feature:dashboards_csp]

enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction = <boolean>
* Whether or not Splunk Web restricts the loading of external content in Studio Dashboards or
  Classic Dashboards.

  * For Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web sets the Content-Security-Policy header, causing the
    browser to block images from external domains not included in the Dashboards Trusted
    Domains List (DTDL).
  * For Classic Dashboards, when the user loads a dashboard with external URLs not included
    in the DTDL, the user sees a warning modal. The user can decide to load the dashboard
    with external content or without external content.
* A value of "false" means the following:
  * For Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web does not set the Content-Security-Policy header. All
    external images load as usual and the browser does not block images.

dashboards_trusted_domain.<name> = <string>

* The list has a maximum size of 6500 characters, after which any excess content will be ignored.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction' has a value of "true",
  then the following happens:
  * In Studio Dashboards, Splunk Web includes the DTDL in the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) page
    header.
    * The CSP header determines which domains Studio Dashboard can use to load images.
    * By default, 'self', data:, and blob: are added to the CSP header.
    * The browser prevents the loading of images from URLs not within the DTDL.
  * In Classic Dashboards, if the dashboard uses external URLs not included in the DTDL to load
    content, the user sees a warning modal.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_external_content_restriction' has a value of "false" then
  the DTDL does not effect Dashboard loading and external content loads without warning.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_redirection_restriction' has a value of "true", users
  see a warning modal when redirecting to an external URL not included in the DTDL.
* If web-features.conf:'enable_dashboards_redirection_restriction' has a value of "false" then the
  DTDL does not affect when a user redirects to an external URL, and no warning modal appears.
* Examples:
  * Only allow images from splunk.com and mozilla.org:
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint1 = www.splunk.com
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint2 = www.mozilla.org
  * Allow images from all external domains:
      dashboards_trusted_domain.endpoint1 = *
